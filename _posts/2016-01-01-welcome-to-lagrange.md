## More Jekyll!

### Millennial

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for a publication or blog.

### Portfolio Jekyll Theme

This is a Jekyll theme built using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). The purpose of this theme is to provide a clean and simple website for your portfolio. Emphasis is placed on your projects, which are shown front and center on the home page.

Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in [the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme), which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/).

Lyra is currently in north Baja Mexico, we have to get some work done on her in the next few weeks including some painting and in inspection of the centerboard which we really hope does not need fixing. We also have to replace a few of the lines including the main halyard. Once this is complete we plan to head south around the end of Baja California and into the Sea of Cortez.

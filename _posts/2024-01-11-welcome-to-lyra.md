Lyra is currently in north Baja Mexico, we have to get some work done on her in the next few weeks including painting and an inspection of the centerboard which we really hope does not result in additonal work. 
We also have to replace a few of the lines including the main halyard. Once this is complete we plan to head south in February around the end of Baja California and into the [Sea of Cortez](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gulf+of+California/@27.2266124,-116.1408045,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86cbcc2e363e4c59:0xd366a88891d18a70!8m2!3d26.7312935!4d-110.7122465!16zL20vMDEyZHdo?entry=ttu) (also called the Gulf California). [Jacques Cousteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau) once called The Sea of Cortez the "The World's Aquarium" and Steinbeck wrote about his adventures there in the book, [The Log from the Sea of Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Log_from_the_Sea_of_Cortez).

Lyra is currently in north Baja Mexico, she needs to be hauled out for a centerboard inspection and to get the bottom painted in addition of several other maintenance jobs. Once this work is completed Lyra is headed, in no hurry, south to the [Sea of Cortez](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gulf+of+California/@27.2266124,-116.1408045,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86cbcc2e363e4c59:0xd366a88891d18a70!8m2!3d26.7312935!4d-110.7122465!16zL20vMDEyZHdo?entry=ttu). We are very much looking forward to exploring the Sea of Cortez or as [Jacques Cousteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau) once called it, "The World's Aquarium". Steinbeck also wrote about his adventures there in the book, [The Log from the Sea of Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Log_from_the_Sea_of_Cortez).

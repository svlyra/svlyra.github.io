We returned to Ensenada on a rainy Tuesday evening. Lyra is docked just off the Malecón (mal-a-con)  in zona centro. The Malecón (pier) and the surrounding area is party central for locals on the weekends. 
This wet evening there were no locals and no tourists. The Plaza Cívica de la Patria (Civic Square of the Homeland) a favorite hang out place in zona centro and it can be full of pop-up stores selling street food, tee-shirts and all kinds of hand made toys and nick-nacks. This evening it was just the two of us.

The Baja Naval (ba-ha nah-val) boatyard has the Malecón on one side and Marina avenue on the other side. On a Saturday or Sunday night this road will be grid locked with cars.

The aftermath of the rain were waterlogged intersections, in our Uber from the bus station several streets were impassable due to flooding. Like California, Baja infrastructure is not not equipped for heavy rain.

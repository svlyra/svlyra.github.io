Lyra was moved to the boat yard for a bottom paint and to address our list of repairs. We moved Lyra from our slip and reversed into a side tie so that the Baja Naval staff can move Lyra into position for the travel lift.

Once in place the Baja Travelift gets in place.

The travelist operator gets the straps around the bottom of the boat and starts lifting.

The lift continues until Lyra is above street level so that it can be moved into the yard.

Once clear to move the travelist moves the boat into the yard.

Lyra being put into position so that the boat stands can be fitted and the travelift can move out. Yes I know, I should have retracted the centerboard. This should not be a problem but the wind generator prevents the 
boat for sitting higher in the travelift.
